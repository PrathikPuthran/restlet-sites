   <h3>Examples from the "REST Web Services" book</h3>

   <p>
      <a href="/documentation/books#restful-web-services">This book</a> is the first 
      one dedicated to REST. It is authored by Leonard Richardson and Sam Ruby
      and published by O'Reilly.
   </p>

   <p>
      For now, please find the <a href="src.zip"> source code</a> of all the
      book examples that were reimplemented using Restlets. Those examples
      are also available and the Restlet distributions under the
      "src/org.restlet.example" directory.
