   <h3>Restlet 1.0 - Benchmark</h3>

   <h4>Introduction</h4>

   <p>
      This section describes some performance tests involving the various
      standalone HTTP server connectors distributed with Restlet Engine.
      For comparison purpose, we also tested the Servlet adapter with popular
      Servlet containers. The tests have been made with the release 1.0 RC6 of
      the Restlet. As the RC6 is the latest release before the final 1.0 one,
      the performance results shouldn't change in any way.
   </p>

   <p>
      This benchmark doesn't aim to provide an absolute comparison between the
      various connectors and Servlet containers tested for at least one reason:
      only their default configuration was used, with no particular optimization
      or performance tuning. We would like to show the behavior of the Restlet
      framework in different situations where the server's load varies from
      light to heavy, and prove that the various connectors are scalable and
      usable in production environments.
   </p>

   <h4>Environment</h4>

   <div>
      The tests have been made on a laptop with the following characteristics:<br/>
      Hardware Environment
      <ul>
         <li>Processor : Pentium M Centrino 1.8 Ghz</li>
         <li>RAM : 1 GB</li>
      </ul>
      Software environment
      <ul>
         <li>OS : Windows XP - service pack 2</li>
         <li>JRE Version : 1.5.0_10-b03</li>
         <li>Java VM : Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM</li>
      </ul>
      Note that the usage of the JVM in the HotSpot server mode is generally
      recommended for Restlet deployments as it tend to slightly improve the performance.

   <h4>Specifications</h4>

   <h5>Stress tool</h5>

   <p>
      The following tests have been made with <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/programs/ab.html">Apache Bench</a> delivered by Apache HTTP Server 2.0.
      Ab especially shows how many requests per second the web server is capable
      of serving. For this benchmark, two files were served: a single HTML page
      (35 kb), and a Zip file (8.8 mb). The maximum number of seconds spent
      benchmarking was limited to 60 seconds and the number of concurrent
      requests varied from 1 to 300.
   </p>

   <p>
      Apache Bench command line:
   </p>

   <pre>
ab -q -t 60 -c %concurrency% -e %csv_test_file%.csv %url_test%
   </pre>

   <p>
      where %concurrency% took the following values: 1, 20, 80, 300.
   </p>

   <h5>Servlet containers configuration</h5>

   <p>
      As written in the introduction, both tested Servlet containers Apache
      Tomcat and Jetty haven't been especially configured for this benchmark.
      They were just installed, and then ready to use.
   </p>

   <h5>Restlet connectors configuration</h5>

   <p>
      The Restlet connectors have been tested with their default behaviour.
      Please refer to the <a href="connectors">connectors page</a> for more
      details about the available parameters for each tested connectors.
   </p>

   <p>
      The application using the restlet connectors has been launched via the
      <a href="http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.org">Tanuki wrapper</a>, that
      provides several kind of nice services especially write once run everywhere
      configuration service. It manages a dedicated JVM instance where your
      application is running. For these tests, the JVM has been configured
      with the following parameters:
   </p>

   <pre>
-server
-Djava.awt.headless=true
-Djava.util.logging.config.file=%PROD_HOME%/data/config/logging.properties
   </pre>

   </p>

   <h4>Conclusion</h4>

   <p>
      These simple tests show that under normal conditions, each connector or
      servlet container responds quickly and correctly. The response time does
      not exceed 12ms for a single HTML page, and under normal
      circumstances is less than 500ms for the zip file. Whatever kind of
      requested file, we can unsurprisingly notice that as the number of
      concurrent requests grows, the time necessary to serve them increases.
   </p>
   <p>
      The results obtained for the single web page are homogeneous between each
      HTTP connectors and between the two tested servlet containers. As an
      exception, the AsyncWeb connector (which has not reached the 1.0 version
      yet) does not support a very high number of concurrent requests.
   </p>
   <p>
      The results obtained for the zip file show a bit more differences between
      the HTTP connectors. We can also notice that the AsyncWeb connector shows
      a better resistance. This may be due to the intrinsec quality of the
      underlying MINA NIO framework.
   </p>
   <p>
      At this point, we must recognize that the tests should be completed,
      especially with graphs showing for example the evolution of the throughput
      and/or latency for a long period of time, etc. But, the aim of these tests
      was only to show that the Restlet Engine provides robust connectors
      and can also be efficiently integrated inside a servlet container.
   </p>
   <p>
      It would also be interesting to compare those results with those of the
      full NIO HTTP connector based on Sun's Grizzly NIO framework, which is
      planned for version 1.1.
