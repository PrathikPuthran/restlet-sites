   <h4><a name="01">1. How can I get the raw HTTP headers if I really need to?</a></h4>

   <p>
      All standard HTTP headers have an equivalent class/property in the Restlet API.
      It was a deliberate choice to not expose those headers as first-class citizens,
      because we consider them as lower-level artifacts and because we want to support
      multiple protocols via the same API.
   </p>

   <p>
      However, it is sometimes necessary to access to the raw HTTP headers or to
      add non-standard headers. For this purpose, we use special Request and Response
      attributes, see details in Javadocs of the <a
      href="api/org/restlet/data/Message.html#getAttributes()">Message.getAttributes()
      method</a>. There is also a sample code in the distribution that illustrates
      how to get raw headers and how to add non-standard ones, see the
      org.restlet.example.misc.HeadersTest class in the "src"
      directory.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="02">2. Can I run Restlets inside Tomcat or any Servlet container?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Yes you can, even if this is not required. If you can't use the
      standalone HTTP connectors provided in the Restlet Engine, you
      can still use the ServerServlet connector which is an adapter between
      the Servlet API and the Restlet API. See the <a
      href="ext/com/noelios/restlet/ext/servlet/ServerServlet.html">
      ServerServlet Javadocs</a> for details on how to configure your Servlet
      container.
   </p>

   <div style="text-align: justify">
      Here is the description of a concrete simple Web application. All
      sources are available
      <a
         href="http://www.restlet.net/source/browse/restlet/trunk/modules/org.restlet.example/src/org/restlet/example/dist/testServlet.zip">here</a>.
      <br/>
      Imagine your simple application is only composed of one package and one
      class :
      <br/>
      <ul>
         <li>Package "com.testServlet"</li>
         <li>Class "com.testServlet.TestServletApplication"</li>
      </ul>
      Your application's root restlet is very simple and is in charge of
      displaying some data taken from the client in an HTML format. Your
      application contains also a "main" method in order to provide the
      standalone mode.
      <br/>
      In standalone mode, the following jars are required in the classpath :
      <ul>
         <li><strong>The standard Restlet API</strong> : "org.restlet.jar"</li>
         <li><strong>The core Restlet Engine</strong> :
         "com.noelios.restlet.jar"</li>
         <li>One server connector that supports the HTTP Protocols. For
         example, use the Simple HTTP Connector :
         "com.noelios.restlet.ext.simple_3.1.jar" and "org.simpleframework.jar".</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      If you want to deploy your application in a servlet container such as
      Tomcat, the following jar files are required in your deployment package
      :
      <ul>
         <li><strong>The standard Restlet API</strong> : "org.restlet.jar"</li>
         <li><strong>The core Restlet Engine</strong> :
         "com.noelios.restlet.jar"</li>
         <li><strong>The servlet connector</strong> :
         "com.noelios.restlet.ext.servlet_2.4.jar"</li>
      </ul>
      Then organize your application as follows before generating the Web
      Application aRchive (e.g. in a
      <a
         href="http://www.restlet.net/source/browse/restlet/trunk/modules/org.restlet.example/src/org/restlet/example/dist/testServlet.war">WAR
      file</a>
      ) :
      <ul>
         <li><strong>/WEB-INF/classes/</strong> - your package and the
         compiled classes.</li>
         <li><strong>/WEB-INF/lib/</strong> - the required jar files.</li>
         <li><strong>/WEB-INF/web.xml</strong> - The <em>Web
         Application Deployment Descriptor</em> for your application.</li>
      </ul>

      Here is a sample configuration of such web.xml file for our simple
      Restlet webapp :
      <pre class="xml:nocontrols:nogutter">
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;ISO-8859-1&quot;?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC
   &quot;-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN&quot;

    &lt;display-name&gt;Test servlet&lt;/display-name&gt;
    &lt;context-param&gt;
            &lt;param-name&gt;org.restlet.application&lt;/param-name&gt;
            &lt;param-value&gt;
               com.testServlet.TestServletApplication
            &lt;/param-value&gt;
    &lt;/context-param&gt;

    &lt;!-- Restlet adapter --&gt;
    &lt;servlet&gt;
            &lt;servlet-name&gt;ServerServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
            &lt;servlet-class&gt;
               com.noelios.restlet.ext.servlet.ServerServlet
            &lt;/servlet-class&gt;
    &lt;/servlet&gt;

    &lt;!-- Catch all requests --&gt;

            &lt;servlet-name&gt;ServerServlet&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
            &lt;url-pattern&gt;/*&lt;/url-pattern&gt;
    &lt;/servlet-mapping&gt;
&lt;/web-app&gt;
      </pre>
   </div>

   <h4><a name="03">3. Can the Restlets composing a site be defined in an XML file?</a></h4>

   <p>
      As XML has been frequently overused as an alternative programming
      language, in the Restlet framework we are very careful about this. We
      think that any configuration that must be done by an application
      developer should be done in Java. In the future, we plan to support XML
      configuration for the Component as this task will often by delegated to
      an administrator without Java knowledge. As you can see in our <a
         href="http://wiki.restlet.org">Community Wiki</a>, several users have
      integrated Restlet with other frameworks like Spring, which support XML
      configuration itself.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="04">4. What JAR files must I have in my classpath for a minimal application?</a></h4>

   <p>
      In a Restlet distribution, all JAR files are located under the
      "lib" directory. The <b>org.restlet.jar</b> file is containing the
      standard Restlet API. Even though you can compile your code with only
      this JAR file, it is likely that you'll need the additional features
      provided by the various Restlet extensions in the <b>org.restlet.ext.*.jar</b>
      files. In any case, to run a minimal application, you'll also need an
      implementation of the API, the core Restlet Engine contained in
      <b>com.noelios.restlet.jar</b>.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="05">5. What are the other JAR files for?</a></h4>

   <p>
      The core NRE doesn't contain any connector to receive or send
      requests. You need to add to your classpath the JAR file of each
      additional connector needed by your application. Check the
      "/lib/README.txt" file in the distribution for a detailled list of all
      the required dependencies for each extension JAR. If you want to act as
      an HTTP server, you can choose between several connectors: standalone
      ones based on Jetty, Simple Framework and AsyncWeb, and one embedded if
      you want to use an existing Servlet container like Tomcat.
   </p>
   <p>
      There are other extensions to the NRE, like HTTP, SMTP and JDBC
      clients. Each one corresponds to a seperate Java package under
      com.noelios.restlet.ext.* and is packaged as a separate JAR file
      available under the "lib" directory. For example, if you need to send
      emails, you must include the following JAR files:
      /lib/com.noelios.restlet.ext.javamail_1.4.jar (NRE extension) and
      /lib/javax.mail_1.4/mail.jar (JavaMail).
   </p>
   <p>
      No further configuration is needed as the NRE runtime will
      automatically detect the extensions present if the application
      classpath. This is the reason why you can rely on the standard Restlet
      API to create connectors, for example: new Server(Protocol.HTTP, 8182,
      target).
   </p>


   <h4><a name="06">6. How do I provide password protection on a server?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Currently, the Noelios Restlet Engine supports Basic HTTP and
      Amazon Web Services authentication schemes. You order to leverage them,
      use the <a href="api/org/restlet/Guard.html">Guard</a>
      Filter. For details on how to use this Filter, please check the <a
         href="tutorial#part09">part 9 of the
      tutorial</a>.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="07">7. How do I check the mime type of a document
   PUT on my server?</a></h4>

   <p>
      This is simple: request.getEntity().getMediaType() which returns
      an instance of the MediaType class. From this instance you can get the
      main and sub types as well as the optional type parameters.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="08">8. How do I attach a status report to a
   client GET when the call fails on my server?</a></h4>

   <p>
      This is also simple:
      response.setStatus(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND). Of course you have a
      complete list of options available in the Status class, closely
      following the HTTP and WebDAV conventions.
   </p>
   <p>
      Finally, a description can be added to the status report to help
      the client understand the situation and correct its request if needed.
      For this purpose, you can create new instances of the <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/Status.html">Status</a>
      class instead of using the constants or, more simply, you can use
      response.setStatus(Status.CLIENT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND, "Your comment goes
      here").
   </p>

   <h4><a name="09">9. What about performance, are new Restlets
   created for each call received on my server?</a></h4>

   <p>
      For a server connector such as Jetty HTTP, the main cost of
      Restlets resides in the creation of the Request and Response objects
      from the low-level HTTP request headers and body. This cost is low and
      is optimized to parse the required headers only when the application
      actually needs the information.
   </p>

   <p>
      For the rest, the Restlet cost happens upon initialization or
      first call. By default, Restlet objects (including Filters,
      Finders and Routers) are shared by all calls. As calls are living in
      separate threads, they can be concurrently processed by the Restlets.
      You only need to be careful when using member variables to store
      temporary state. If at some point in your application, you need to have
      state that is specific to your call, you should use the
      Request.getAttributes() or Response.getAttributes() as a modifiable map
      of attributes. In the final Finder, a new instance of the target Resource
      class is automatically by default, which let you deal call's specific
      information.
   </p>

   <p>
      For those concerned by performance, we have published a <a href="benchmark">
      benchmark</a> illustrating that Restlets are scalable and efficient.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="10">10. How do I implement the traditional MVC
   pattern?</a></h4>

   <p>
      There is only a rough correspondence between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller">MVC
      pattern</a> and the Restlet framework; some <a href="http://n2.nabble.com/Restlet-MVC-tp1560691p1561792.html">debate</a>
      exists as to whether it should be employed at all. For those who wish to follow 
      the MVC pattern with Restlet, here is the basic proposition:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>Controller == Restlets (mainly Filters, Routers, Finders). You
      can visualize the controller as a sort of processing chain, where the
      last node should be a Hander with all the information necessary to
      locate the target Resource for the call. This location information can
      be stored either in the request's attributes map, either in the member
      variables of a request wrapper (see <a
         href="api/org/restlet/util/WrapperRequest.html">org.restlet.WrapperRequest</a>).
      This last Finder should override the findTarget(Request, Response)
      method and return an instance of Resource.</li>
      <li>Model == Resource + data objects. Just start from the <a
         href="api/org/restlet/resource/Resource.html">org.restlet.resource.Resource
      class</a> and implement its methods like getVariants(), post(), delete()
      and put(). The Finder class automatically invokes those methods by
      implementing the handleGet(), handleHead(), handlePost(), handlePut(),
      handleDelete() methods for you. For example, you just need to override
      the getVariants() to benefit from automatic content negotiation.
      Internally, we rely on the Response.setEntity(Resource, Language)
      method to trigger this content negotiation, which compares the
      representations that you make available (named the variants), with the
      client capabilities and preferences.</li>
      <li>View == Representation. To create new representations for your
      resources, you can rely on one of the numerous Representation
      implementation classes (InputRepresentation for example) available in
      the org.restlet.resource package or in extension packages like for JSON
      documents, FreeMarker and Velocity templates.</li>
   </ol>

   <h4><a name="11">11. Any recommendations/guidelines in terms of
   how to deal with caching?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Currently, client-side caching is supported via the "conditions"
      property of Call. See the <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/Conditions.html">
      Conditions</a> class for details. So, the first recommendation is to ensure
      that you correctly set all the representation metadata for your own
      representations (modification date, expiration date, tag). That will
      ensure that the server-side negotiation logic (used via the
      Response.setEntity(Resource, Language) method) works optimally.
   </p>

   <p>
      Then, writing a generic server-side cache is a different story.
      The recommendation would be to follow the REST style and HTTP
      specification spirit as closely as possible. For full-featured caching,
      you should look at popular projects like Squid:
      http://www.squid-cache.org/ or Apache caching modules. These caches can
      be installed transparently for the clients, as reverse proxies.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="12">12. What is the performance of the HTTP
   connectors?</a></h4>

   <p>
      For server connectors, the performance will depend on the actual
      provider used and whether you deploy your application with a standalone
      connector or embedded in a Servlet container. We have published a
      <a href="benchmark">benchmark</a> illustrating that Restlets are scalable
      and efficient, but encourage you to do your own tests within your target
      deployment environment.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="13">13. Why is my HTTP client sending unwanted
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type headers?</a></h4>

   <p>
      When you do a simple GET with the Restlet HTTP client connector based
      on JDK's HttpURLConnection, an extra "content-type" header can be sent
      to the server, even though your call doesn't provide any input content (because you
      just GET a representation). This is due to a bug in JDK 5.0 that was fixed in
      update 10 and in JDK 6.0 as indicated in the <a
         href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6369510">bug
      report</a>.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="14">14. Can a Filter modify the call like a
   Servlet Filter?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Absolutely! What the tutorial only says is that request's base
      reference should rarely be modified. Beside that, anything else in the
      request or response objects can be modified, before or after the
      handling of the call by the attached Restlet.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="15">15. My server is running behind a proxy, can I
   get the actual client IP address?</a></h4>

   <p>
      The immediate client IP address available is the only that is
      always available because its based on the underlying protocol
      connection. In HTTP, certain proxies do transfer the original client IP
      address (or addresses) by using some extra HTTP headers like
      "X-Forwarded-for". In the recent Restlet versions you can get all this
      information in a straightforward way. On the ClientInfo class,
      accessible via the <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/Request.html#getClientInfo()">getClientInfo()</a>
      method, you have two related methods <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/ClientInfo.html#getAddress()">getAddress()</a>
      and <a
         href="api/org/restlet/data/ClientInfo.html#getAddresses()">getAddresses()</a>.
      Please check the Javadocs of the HTTP server connectors for details
      (i.e. context parameter to set) on how to enable the support for the
      "X-Forwarded-For" header as there are some security risks when using it,
      especially if you are not controlling the intermediary proxies.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="16">16. Is there a mechanism to pass data sets to
   downstream Restlets?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Yes, there are multiple mechanisms available. If you need to
      store state, without any validation logic or behavior, you can use the
      Request.getAttributes() method which returns a modifiable map object.
      Otherwise, you can wrap the Request object into a larger one containing
      the extra properties and methods that you need. For this purpose, you
      just have to create a subclass of org.restlet.util.WrapperRequest. Then,
      in one of your handle methods, you can simply wrap the current call
      instance. Unless you use a common base Restlet you will need to properly
      cast the call instance in subsequent Restlets in order to access to your
      wrapper methods.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="17">17. What is the difference between a Filter
   and a Router?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Filters support some processing before or after the handling of a
      call by a target Restlet. They are useful for actions like logging,
      caching, compressing or security checks. The purpose of Routers is to
      route calls based on some any useful criteria, typically base on the
      relative target URI. Routers can distribute calls to one or more
      attached Restlets using intermediary Routes. A Route is a simple Filter
      where the target Restlet is attached and that can score incoming calls.
      Depending on the Routes and the routing algorithm used, the Router will
      select the most appropriate target Restlet to continue the processing of
      the call. Default Routes based on URI patterns will also update the
      "Request.resourceRef.baseRef" property before actually invoking the
      selected target Restlet. See also, <a href="/about/faq#02">this FAQ entry</a>
      for a comparison of Routers with the Servlet API.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="18">18. How can I send and receive files with
   Restlet?</a></h4>

   <p>
      To receive large files, from browsers for example, you can rely

   <h4><a name="19">19. How can I make PUT or DELETE calls from
   browsers?</a></h4>

   <p>
      There are two solutions to this problem. The first one is to
      tunnel the PUT or DELETE calls through regular POST calls. There is a <a
         href="api/org/restlet/service/TunnelService.html">TunnelService</a>
      associated with each Application that automatically takes care of it.
      Also, in the <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/lpt/a/6480">Using REST
      with Ajax</a> article, the author explains how to directly build the PUT and
      DELETE methods from a browser using some JavaScript code.

   <h4><a name="20">20. What's the best practice for error
   handling in an intermediate Restlet?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Typically, unexpected exceptions are handled at the Application
      level, by setting the status to 500 (internal server error). If you want
      a different status when an exception is thrown, you have to catch it
      manually at a lower level (inside the handle(Call) or
      handleGet|Post|etc. method of your intermediary Restlet) and set the
      desired status on your response.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="21">21. What is the best way to use Restlet in
   Eclipse?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Of course, you could manually use the JAR files in your Eclipse
      projects, but the most flexible way is to rely on Eclipse's plug-in
      infrastructure. Here are some detailed steps to get you started:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>Drop the content of the Restlet's "lib/" directory into
      Eclipse's plug-in directory</li>
      <li>Restart Eclipse and go into "Help/About Eclipse SDK" menu</li>
      <li>In the new dialog, click on the "Plug-in Details" button</li>
      <li>In the new dialog, you should see the registered plugins, for
      example under the "Restlet S.A.S." provider name</li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      Now in order to use those plugins:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>Select "New Project" and choose "Plug-in Project"</li>
      <li>Click "Next &gt;", eeter a project name and click "Next &gt;"
      again</li>
      <li>Disable the plug-in options checkboxes (unless you do need
      them)</li>
      <li>Click "Finish" and you should see you new project with the
      plug-in "Overview" panel displayed</li>
      <li>Select the "Dependencies" tab and click "Add..." in the
      "Required Plug-ins..." section</li>
      <li>Select the plugins you need, start by either "org.restlet",
      "com.noelios.restlet" or the package name for third-party libraries
      (Jetty, Servlet API, etc.).</li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      Now you're done! You can create new classes and import the
      org.restlet.* packages to work with Restlets. Note, that if you add
      several server HTTP dependencies, only the first one in the list will be
      use to create connectors.
   </p>

   <p>
      Also note that you can't add a dependency to Jetty 5 and Jetty 6
      at the same time as it will result in a security exception as you
      experienced, because they use overlapping package names.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="22">22. How can I change the configuration of my connector?</a></h4>

   <p>
      Each connector has a set of specific parameters that can be changed
      to tune their default configuration. Changing those parameters doesn't
      require a direct access to the connector internal classes. Here is
      an example illustrating how to change the request buffer size for the
      Jetty connector:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
Server myServer = new Server(Protocol.HTTP, 8182, restlet);
myServer.getContext().getParameters().add("requestBufferSize", "30000");
myServer.start();
   </pre>

   <h4><a name="23">23. How can I integrate with Spring?</a></h4>

   <p>
      During the development of the 1.0 version of the API, several users attempted
      to integrate Restlet with Spring. They were especially trying to use the
      XML-based bean wiring feature of Spring. This resulted in several examples
      available on the <a href="http://wiki.restlet.org">community Wiki</a>.
   </p>

   <p>
      In order to facilitate this integration, a dedicated Spring extension was added
      to the Restlet distribution and the Servlet extension was modified. It allows
      us to provide two main integration modes.
   </p>

   <p>
      In the first mode, the goal is to leverage the concept of Restlet Application
      and all the associated services, as well as the transparent deployment to either
      a Servlet container (using the adapter ServerServlet extension class) or using
      a standalone HTTP server connector. For this, you can leverage the SpringContext
      class which is a Spring's GenericApplicationContext subclass. You can associate
      a list of property-based on XML-based configuration URIs (file:/// or war:/// URIs)
      in order to have Spring auto-instantiate and wire your Restlet beans.
   </p>

   <p>
      In the second mode, the goal is to leverage the concept of Spring Web Application
      as an alternative to the Restlet Application. This is sometimes required when
      the Restlet code is only part of a much larger Spring-based Web application, with
      dependencies on the Servlet API. Initially, it was hard to achieve this integration
      because the Servlet extension, and especially the ServerServlet adapter class
      was assuming the usage of a Restlet Application. This was redundant in this mode
      so we later added a lighter adapter based on the ServletConverter class. With this
      converter, you can directly instantiate Restlet Routers, Finders and Resources
      from your existing Servlet-based Spring code. Check the Javadocs for details.
   </p>

   <p>
      Finally, there is also a SpringFinder class available in the Spring extension.
      It hasn't any specific dependency to Spring, but the addition of a parameter-less
      createResource() method allows the usage of the Spring's "lookup-method"
      mechanism.
   </p>

   <h4><a name="24">24. Can I prevent child URIs from being matched by Routers?</a></h4>

   <p>
      The default behavior of a Router is to match the beginning of the request URI
      (actually the remaining part, left by previous Routers) with the attached URI
      patterns. If the request URI indeed starts with one of the URI patterns, the
      target Resource or Restlet is invoked.
   </p>

   <p>
      This default behavior is desirable to allow optional query strings in URI routing.
      However, it is sometimes preferred to be stricter about the match and to require
      that the request URI exactly matches the URI pattern, with no remaining part. In
      order to obtain this behavior, you just need to change the matching mode for the
      attached template. Here is a sample code:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
Route route = router.attach("/users/{user}", UserResource.class);
route.getTemplate().setMatchingMode(Template.MODE_EQUALS);
   </pre>

   <p>
      Note that after doing this, your Router won't accept URI with query strings going
      to this Resource. To solve this, you can explicitely allow the query part in your
      URI template:
   </p>

   <pre class="java:nocontrols:nogutter">
Route route = router.attach("/users/{user}?{query}", UserResource.class);
route.getTemplate().setMatchingMode(Template.MODE_EQUALS);
   </pre>
