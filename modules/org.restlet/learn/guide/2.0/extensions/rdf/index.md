RDF extension
=============

Introduction
============

This extension provides supports for the core standard of the Semantic
Web: the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It support all major RDF
serialization formats (n3, Turtle, NTriples and RDF/XML) and can work in
either a DOM-like or SAX-like way, with a unified API!

See the [Javadocs for more
details](http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/snapshot/ext/index.html?org/restlet/ext/rdf/package-summary.html).
