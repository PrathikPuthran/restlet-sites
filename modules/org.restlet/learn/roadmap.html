	</h4>

	<p>Our current goal is to develop version 2.2 of the Restlet
		Framework based on this plan.</p>

	<p>This document contains a rather detailled roadmap for future
		Restlet version and is continuously updated to indicate the progress
		made and the adjustments necessary. The goal for next 2.x versions of
		the Restlet Framework is to develop incremental releases in a short
		time-frame of about 6 months.</p>

	<h5 id="support-for-spdy">Support for SPDY</h5>
	<p>
		As this protocol <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://www.chromium.org/spdy">defined
			by Google</a> is gaining more acceptance with its <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Silk">support
			in Amazon Silk browser</a> and is compatible with HTTP semantics, hence
		with the Restlet API, we will add support for it by leveraging and
		extending our internal NIO connector. Mozilla is <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/Features/SPDY">also
			adding support for SPDY</a> in Firefox.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://www.mnot.net/blog/2009/11/13/flip">some
			good chances</a> that a HTTP/2.0 standardization effort will emerge in
		the near future, also based on Roy T. Fielding's Waka and the <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://trac.tools.ietf.org/wg/httpbis/trac/wiki">HTTPbis
			working group</a> that split the HTTP/1.1 specification in several layer,
		including a separate messaging layer and semantics layer. See <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://blog.noelios.com/2011/10/06/can-the-rise-of-spdy-threaten-http/">this
			blog post</a> for details on Noelios's vision.
	</p>
	<p>We will also further optimize those NIO connectors (HTTP, SIP
		and SPDY) by performing a comparison benchmark with other connectors
		(Jetty, Simple) and further improving the NIO controller loop. We will
		also facilitate the reporting of statistics on the connector via the
		ConnetorService, such as the number of active connections, the number
		of calls per second and so on. Finally, we will attempt to use a
		single NIO controller to manage several connector instances (client
		and server sides, several listening addresses, etc.).</p>

	<h6 id="forge-migration-to-github">Forge migration to GitHub</h6>
	<p>
		Over the past years, the GitHub service has gained a lot of popularity
		to host open source projects. Our goal is to migrate our source code
		repository and issue tracker from <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://restlet.tigris.org/">Tigris</a>
		to <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.
		Beside the modern user interface, one major advantage will be the
		management of contributions via the &quot;pull requests&quot; feature.
		As a result, we will switch from SVN to Git.
	</p>
	<h6 id="user-questions-migration-to-stackoverflow">User questions
		migration to StackOverflow</h6>
	<p>
		Over the past years, the <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>
		service has gained a lot of popularity and many Restlet users have
		naturally started to ask their usage questions via this site. While
		initially hard to keep track of in addition to our regular mailing
		list on Tigris, we know think that this is more convenient for many
		kinds of questions.
	</p>
	<p>
		The plan is to make this support more official and promote the usage
		of StackOverflow on Restlet web site. See the <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/restlet">existing
			Restlet related questions</a>.
	</p>
	<h6 id="mailing-lists-migration-to-google-groups">Mailing lists
		migration to Google Groups</h6>
	<p>
		Taking into account the migration of the Restlet forge (source code,
		issue tracker and misc downloads) from Tigris to GitHub, the last
		remaining service will be our mailing lists. To simplify our community
		management tasks, we intend to merge both discuss@restlet.tigris.org
		and code@restlet.tigris.org mailing lists to the new version/UI of <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/https://groups.google.com/forum/#%21overview">Google
			Groups</a>.
	</p>
	<h5 id="migration-to-java-se-6">Migration to Java SE 6</h5>
	<p>
		The main code trunk will be migrated from Java SE 5, that reached its
		end of life, to Java SE 6. We will look at taking advantage on <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/features-141434.html">new
			features added</a>and will also leverage the new Servlet 3.0 API which
		requires Java SE 6 as well.
	</p>
	<h5 id="option-for-apache-license-2.0">Option for Apache License
		2.0</h5>
	<p>
		In addition to LGPL 2.1/3.0, EPL 1.0 and CDDL 1.0 currently proposed,
		we are planning to add another open source license option for the <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache
			License 2.0</a>. This will make the usage of Restlet in Apache Foundation
		projects <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html#category-b">easier</a>.
	</p>
	<h5 id="new-tutorial">New tutorial</h5>
	<p>So far our user guide documentation has been rather technical,
		with first steps documents, basic tutorials, edition and extension
		description and Javadocs. In addition, we are publishing the
		comprehensive &quot;Restlet in Action&quot; book for users wanting to
		get a deeper understanding of the framework.</p>
	<p>However, we received several feed-back for a better introductory
		documentation, that would help understand the potential of the
		technology with a sensible use case, a complete end-to-end example
		including persistence and UI. This would also give a way to share best
		practices and illustrate usage scenarios of the technology such as:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>open web API</li>
		<li>cloud migration and portability</li>
		<li>mobile web sites and services</li>
		<li>unification of web sites and web services</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Therefore, we want to write a new and in depth tutorial presenting a
		example comparable to <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://docs.jboss.org/seam/2.2.1.CR1/reference/en-US/html/tutorial.html#booking">Seam's
			Hotel Booking one</a> or a RESTful Java PetStore (we already have a
		prototype based on older 1.1 version).
	</p>
	<h5 id="size-optimization-of-editions">Size optimization of
		editions</h5>
	<p>Restlet editions for Android and GWT required special
		adaptations in version 2.0 to run in those restricted environments. In
		version 2.2, we want to go further into the customization effort, with
		a special focus on footprint.</p>
	<p>Regarding Android, the core org.restlet.jar for Android contains
		the internal Restlet HTTP connector (client and server), but in many
		cases, we could just leverage the client connector based on Apache
		HTTP Client, especially because it is part of the Android runtime. We
		should therefore provide an addition org.restlet.jar file, without the
		internal connector but preconfigured to leverage Apache HTTP Client,
		resulting in a smaller footprint. Also, there is a Base 64
		implementation in android.util that we could leverage as well as
		Apache HTTP Components 4.0 on the server side.</p>
	<p>Regarding GWT, we added support for annotated interfaces and
		client proxies in version 2.0 with automatic POJOs serialization and
		deserialization, generated using GWT's deferred binding mechanism.
		When using those proxies, we rely on the whole Restlet Core (GWT
		edition) for the actual implementation, but this is mostly transparent
		unless the user needs to modify the underlying ClientResource for
		advanced use cases (authentication is a classic case).</p>
	<p>In order to not add the footprint of the Restlet Core in those
		simple cases, we could optionally generate a lighter proxy relying
		directly and only on GWT's lower-level HTTP API and the classes needed
		for serialization and deserialization from GWT-RPC internal packages.</p>
	<p>In addition, we will look into distributing several profiles for
		each Restlet module, like a client-side only
		&quot;org.restlet-client.jar&quot; and
		&quot;org.restlet-server.jar&quot; in addition to
		&quot;org.restlet.jar&quot;. The Restlet API and Engine would be
		unchanged, just partially shipped in those JAR files.</p>
	<h5 id="osgi-environments-edition">OSGi Environments edition</h5>
	<p>We will enhance the edition for OSGi Environments added late in
		the Restlet Framework 2.1 development process, in order to take full
		advantage of the available OSGi core services, such as the log service
		and the HTTP service.</p>
	<p>
		We will add an org.restlet.ext.osgi extension facilitating the
		development of highly dynamic Restlet applications, by integrating the
		code currently in the Restlet incubator. See <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://wiki.restlet.org/developers/172-restlet/g4/124-restlet.html">this
			specification document</a> for additional details.
	</p>
	<h5 id="cache-service">Cache service</h5>
	<p>The Restlet API has a comprehensive support for HTTP caching
		metadata and directives. However, we have no built-in way to support
		client-side and server-side caching of actual representation content.</p>
	<p>
		The plan is to provide a CacheService class with configuration option
		based on size, media type and so on, with a default behavior and a
		very extensible implementation to plug any kind of caching mechanism
		(in memory, on file, distributed cache, database, etc.). For details,
		see <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://wiki.restlet.org/172-restlet/g2/388-restlet.html">this
			specification document</a>.
	</p>
	<h5 id="restlet-api">Restlet API</h5>
	<p>Beyond the above mentioned features, here are some additional
		ones that we are considering:</p>
	<p>Removal of deprecated artifacts in the API, engine and
		extensions to reduce size</p>
	<p>Consider a Container/Composite class, parent of Component and
		Application</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Restlets and resource classes contained in a Composite cannot
			directly manipulate objects outside their parent container</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Support server-side resource proxies based on Restlet annotated
		interfaces that would allow a POJO to become a stateful REST resource.
		Those objects would be thread-safe all potentially called by several
		threads at the same time</p>
	<h5 id="easier-dependency-injection">Easier dependency injection</h5>
	<h6 id="guice-extension">Guice extension</h6>
	<p>There is already such an extension maturing in the Restlet
		Incubator that we should try to migrate to the main trunk. Necessary
		adjustments to the Restlet API should also be made.</p>
	<h4 id="version-2.3">Version 2.3</h4>
	<h5 id="eclipse-ide-tooling">Eclipse IDE tooling</h5>
	<p>
		In order to facilitate the usage of the Restlet Framework withing
		Eclipse IDE, we would like to start providing tooling support such as
		wizards to facilitate the creation of Restlet applications, filters,
		resources, etc. See <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://wiki.restlet.org/172-restlet/g5/361-restlet.html">this
			wiki page for details</a>.
	</p>
	<p>In addition, the core development team will migrate to the
		latest version of Eclipse Indigo (3.7) as their main IDE development
		tool, ensuring that no errors and warnings appear with the source code
		in trunk.</p>
	<h5 id="pure-javascript-edition-in-progress">Pure JavaScript
		edition [in progress]</h5>
	<p>Due to the emergence of HTML 5 on all sorts of browser platforms
		(mobile), the improvement of JavaScript engines such as Chrome V8 and
		the emergence of Node.js on the server-side, it sounds like a good
		time to push for a comprehensive Restlet port to JavaScript both
		client-side (browser and Node.js) and server-side (Node.js), reusing
		the Restlet API semantics but in clean JavaScript way.</p>
	<p>
		Of course, we already have the GWT edition of Restlet which provides a
		nice solution, but there seems to be room for a more hypermedia
		driven/document oriented solution, combining AJAX and UI libraries
		such as jQuery, Ext JS, YUI to name a few. In Restlet Incubator, we
		already have a prototype of such port working in both browsers and
		Node.js on the client-side. See <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://wiki.restlet.org/172-restlet/g5/368-restlet.html">this
			specifications document</a> for details.
	</p>
	<h5 id="dart-edition">Dart edition</h5>
	<p>
		<a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://www.dartlang.org/">Dart</a>
		is a promising programming language launched by Google in 2011 at the
		cross-roads of JavaScript and Java that is both statically and
		dynamically typed. It looks easier to port Restlet to than to pure
		JavaScript, a bit similar to the porting done for the GWT edition.
	</p>
	<h5 id="enhanced-conneg-service">Enhanced conneg service</h5>
	<p>We want to facilitate content negotiation based on other
		dimensions than representation metadata byenhancing the existing
		ConnegService added in version 2.1. For example the
		&quot;account.html.ftl.ie&quot; file could be mapped to the HTML media
		type, decoded using the FreeMarker template engine and returned only
		for Internet Explorer. The &quot;vary&quot; HTTP header
		(Response#dimensions property) should also be updated properly.
		Example of new dimensions that could be taken into account:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>user agent type (ex: Firefox)</li>
		<li>user agent category (ex: mobile, desktop, etc.)</li>
		<li>user agent version</li>
		<li>user preferences</li>
		<li>IP address and domain name (ex: UI branding, white-label)</li>
		<li>authentication state (ex: anonymous version)</li>
		<li>authorization state (ex: user role)</li>
	</ul>
	<h5 id="enhanced-converter-service">Enhanced converter service</h5>
	<p>The current converter service supports the serialization of
		objects into representations or the deserialization of representations
		into objects. This works fine and uses a plugin mechanism for
		extensions such as XStream, Jackson, JAXB, JiBX and a few more. We
		want to go beyond in 2.1 and support three other scenarios.</p>
	<h6 id="unified-bean-converter">Unified bean converter</h6>
	<p>
		We currently rely on many extension to support serialization between
		POJOs and common formats such as JSON (JSON.org, XStream+Jettison,
		Jackson), XML (XStream, JAXB, JiBX), RDF, GWT, etc. However, those
		extensions and related libraries tend to have much redundancy and lack
		integration with REST representations such as metadata and hyperlinks.
		As Roy T. Fielding reminded in <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">this
			blog post</a>, REST APIs must be hypermedia-driven, especially on the
		client-side if you really want to loosely couple web clients with web
		servers.
	</p>
	<p>
		We will help Restlet users to easily support conneg over various media
		types, with a single consistent set of representation annotations and
		illustrate this support for common media types such as XML, JSON,
		HTML/Form post, RDF or CSV. See <a
			href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111225113020/http://wiki.restlet.org/172-restlet/365-restlet.html">this
			specifications page</a> for more details.
	</p>
	<p id="from-representation-to-representation">From representation
		to representation</p>
	<p>This is based on a transformation document (typically a template
		or skeleton of the result document). An example case is the usage of
		XSLT to automatically convert a WADL representation or a
		XStream/JAXB/JiBX XML representation into HTML representations. A
		mechanism to register or discover the transformation documents should
		be provided, based on the source and result media types.</p>
	<p id="from-object-to-representation-using-a-template-document">From
		object to representation using a template document</p>
	<p>An example is an object returned by a @Get annotated Java
		method) that needs to be converted into a result representation (for
		example an HTML document). There are currently two ways provided by
		the framework to do that via the FreeMarker and Velocity extensions.
		This idea would be to simplify the usage of those extensions and their
		TemplateRepresentation classes via the ConverterService.</p>
	<p>It would also be useful to be able to select a different
		template based on a query parameter or any attribute actually, for
		example to display a read-only HTML document or an HTML form capable
		of editing the resource.</p>
	<p>
		This would be pluggable so other template mechanisms such as <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/">Acceleo</a> (generates text
		from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">EMF</a> beans)
		could be supported. A mechanism to register or discover the
		transformation documents should be provided (for example based on the
		qualified class name of the source object in a base directory of
		templates).
	</p>
	<p id="from-object-to-object-using-a-transformation-document">From
		object to object using a transformation document</p>
	<p>
		Third, the conversion of a source object into a result object should
		be supported. This could be leveraged by technologies such <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/m2m/atl/">ATL</a> (transforms source <a
			href="http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/">EMF</a> beans into result
		EMF beans). A mechanism to register or discover the transformation
		documents should be provided, based on the source and result qualified
		class names.
	</p>
	<h5 id="support-html-5-server-sent-events">Support HTML 5
		Server-Sent events</h5>
	<p>This W3C specification part of HTML 5 is now supported in major
		web browsers and is RESTful so we should support it directly in the
		framework. Generally, we should Improve our asynchronous support for
		use cases such as CouchDB notifications and Twitter live API.</p>
	<h5 id="easier-dependency-injection-1">Easier dependency injection</h5>
	<h6 id="spring-extension">Spring extension</h6>
	<p>
		We will add support for custom XML schema in Spring, based on our
		existing custom XML syntax implemented by the Component class. This
		will also be the opportunity to improve the Spring extension document
		which is a regular topic for questions. See related issues <a
			href="http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=614">#614</a>,
