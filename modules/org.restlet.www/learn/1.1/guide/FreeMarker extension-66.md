FreeMarker extension
====================

Introduction
============

This extension provides an integration with FreeMarker 2.3. FreeMarker
is a template engine, a generic tool to generate text output (anything
from HTML to autogenerated source code) based on templates. For details
on FreeMarker, see the [home
page](http://web.archive.org/web/20090205114816/http://freemarker.org/).

Description
===========

When you need to generate a dynamic document based on a data model and a
FreeMarker template (skeleton document similar to a JSP page or an XSLT
stylesheet), you just need to create an instance of the
TemplateRepresentation class with the matching parameters and to set it
as the response entity.

Please, refer to the [FreeMarker extension
Javadocs](http://web.archive.org/web/20090205114816/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/ext/org/restlet/ext/freemarker/package-summary.html)
and the [FAQ
\#10](http://web.archive.org/web/20090205114816/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/faq#10)
