Overview
========

Restlet is a lightweight REST framework for Java that lets you embrace
the architecture of the Web and benefit from its simplicity and
scalability. By leveraging our innovative REST engine, you can start
blending your Web Sites and Web Services into uniform Web Applications!

Restlet has a light core but thanks to its pluggable extension, it is
also a comprehensive REST framework for Java. It supports all REST
concepts (Resource, Representation, Connector, Component, etc.) and is
suitable for both client and server Web applications.

It supports major Web standards like HTTP, SMTP, XML, JSON, WADL, and
Atom. Many extensions are also available to integrate with Servlet,
Spring, Jetty, Grizzly, Simple, JAXB, JAX-RS, JiBX, Velocity, or
FreeMarker.

A GWT version is also available and is a direct port of the main Java
version.
