JSON extension
==============

Introduction
============

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a compact format for representing
structured data. It became a popular alternative to XML in AJAX
applications due to its native support by Web browser. JSON is indeed
based on the JavaScript syntax. See [JSON
project](http://web.archive.org/web/20090406195158/http://www.json.org/)
for more details.

Description
===========

This extension adds support for JSON representations. It enables you to
create JsonRepresentation instances from the two kinds of structure
defined by JSON: objects and arrays, and to make the reverse conversion.
JsonRepresentations can also be generated from String and any kind of
Representation.

Please, refer to the [JSON extension
