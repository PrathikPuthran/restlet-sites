Pluggable authenticators
========================

This feature allows to plug support for new authentication schemes into
the engine in a way similar to Restlet connectors.

Currently, there is one example available with the [OAuth
extension](http://web.archive.org/web/20090126045415/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_1.1/13-restlet/28-restlet/80-restlet.html "OAuth extension").
