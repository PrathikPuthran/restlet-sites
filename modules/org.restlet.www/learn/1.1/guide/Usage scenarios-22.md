Usage scenarios
===============

Introduction
============

Restlet is a very flexible framework that is suitable for most Web
application developments.

Client and server side
======================

Thanks for its unique design, it can be used for both client-side and
server-side applications and of course for applications that act as both
clients and servers. With the availability of a port for the GWT
plateform, it can also works in your favorite Web browser!

Servlet compatible
==================

Restlet was an attempt to build a better Servlet API, more inline with
the true Web architecture (REST) and standards (HTTP, URI). Therefore
the Restlet API has no dependency on the Servlet API, it only depends on
the Java SE. However, it is perfectly possible to deploy a Restlet
application into JEE application server and Servlet containers. This is
possible using a simple adapter Servlet provided as an extension.

Complete Web server
===================

Contrary to the Servlet API, the Restlet API gives you an extensive
control on the URI mapping and on the virtual hosts configuration. It
allows includes a powerful Directory class to server static files in a
way comparable to what a Apache Web Server would do. For example, we run
our Restlet.org web site directly with Restlet!

Technology agnostic
===================

By staying open to all presentation technologies (HTML, Swing, Eclipse,
GWT, AJAX, etc.), all persistence technologies (JDBC, Hibernate, db4o,
iBatis, etc.) and all execution environments (standalone Java, JEE,
Servlet, Spring, OSGi, Guice, SLEE, etc.), your investment in Restlet is
secured. With very little care, your Restlet applications can even be
fully portable from one environment to the other.
