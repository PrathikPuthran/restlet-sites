Restlet API
===========

This chapter presents the Restlet API. It is a small set of packages,
with classes, interfaces and enumerations that together provide a
framework. This framework will guide you on the path to RESTful design
and development. But be aware that you still need to understand REST in
order to fully take advantage of the [Restlet
features](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104202333/http://www.restlet.org/about/features).
For this purpose, [we recommend the book "RESTful Web
Services"](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104202333/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/books)
from O'Reilly. We even wrote a part of it covering Restlet usage.

For a more detailed presentation of the API, we recommend that you have
a close look at the [Restlet
Tutorial](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104202333/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/tutorial)
and at the [Javadocs of the
API](http://web.archive.org/web/20120104202333/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/api/),
both available on the Restlet Web site.
