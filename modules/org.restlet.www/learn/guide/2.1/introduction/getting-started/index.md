Getting started
===============

This section explains how to get started with the Restlet Framework,
including set up and debugging tools in common development environments
such as:

-   [Eclipse
    IDE](http://web.archive.org/web/20111013181457/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/93-restlet.html "Getting started with Eclipse IDE")
-   [Maven](http://web.archive.org/web/20111013181457/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/92-restlet.html "Getting started with Maven")
-   [Maven and
    Spring](http://web.archive.org/web/20111013181457/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/381-restlet.html "Getting Started with Maven and Spring")
-   [Debugging
    tools](http://web.archive.org/web/20111013181457/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/21-restlet/192-restlet/102-restlet.html "Debugging tools")

In addition, we highly recommend that you read these [community
tutorials](http://web.archive.org/web/20111013181457/http://wiki.restlet.org/community/167-restlet.html)
provided by Restlet users in various forms:

-   Detailled article
-   YouTube videos
-   Blog posts

Finally, there is the "[Restlet in
Action](http://web.archive.org/web/20111013181457/http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1121_217)"
book written by Restlet creators and published by Manning that is a
highly recommended reading for a smoother Restlet learning curve.
