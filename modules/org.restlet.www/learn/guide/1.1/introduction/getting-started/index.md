Getting started
===============

We recommend that you consult the [documentation available on the
Restlet Web
site](http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/)
to get you started. You will find a screencast, first steps and more
detailed tutorial.

In addition, we highly recommend that you read these [community
tutorials](http://wiki.restlet.org/community/167-restlet.html)
provided by Restlet users in various forms:

-   Detailled article
-   YouTube videos
-   Blog posts

Finally, there is the "[Restlet in
Action](http://www.manning.com/affiliate/idevaffiliate.php?id=1121_217)"
book written by Restlet creators and published by Manning that is a
highly recommended reading for a smoother Restlet learning curve.
