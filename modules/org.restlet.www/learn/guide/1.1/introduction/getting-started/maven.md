Setting up your environment with Maven
======================================

Maven is a comprehensive project management system built around the
concept of POM (Project Object Model). One of the main advantages is the
automated handling of project dependencies, including their download.
For more information on Maven, check the [project home
page](http://maven.apache.org/).

It is easy to use Restlet in a Maven environment because all the Restlet
artifacts are published in a dedicated Maven repository. For
configuration details, you can [read this
