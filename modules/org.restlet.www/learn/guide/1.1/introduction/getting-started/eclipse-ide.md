Setting up your environment with Eclipse
========================================

There are two ways to use Restlet within Eclipse. The first is to use
the Restlet JARs as external project dependencies. This is very simple
and works well in most cases.

The second is to install Restlet JARs as Eclipse/OSGi bundles. All
Restlet JARs including dependencies are valid OSGi bundles, so this is
very convenient if you work in an Eclipse plug-in environment, such as
an Eclipse RCP application.

to use Restlet in
Eclipse?](http://www.restlet.org/documentation/1.1/faq#21)
