Overview
========

Restlet is a comprehensive yet lightweight RESTful web framework for
Java that lets you embrace the architecture style of the Web (REST) and
benefit from its simplicity and scalability. By leveraging our
innovative framework, you can start blending your web services, web
sites and web clients into uniform web applications!

Restlet has a light core but thanks to its pluggable extension, it is
also a comprehensive REST framework for Java. It supports all REST
concepts (Resource, Representation, Connector, Component, etc.) and is
suitable for both client and server Web applications.

It supports major Web standards like HTTP, SMTP, XML, JSON, WADL, and
Atom. Many extensions are also available to integrate with Servlet,
Spring, Jetty, Grizzly, Simple, JAXB, JAX-RS, JiBX, Velocity,
FreeMarker, XStream, Jackson, SLF4J, ROME, Netty and many more!

Several editions for GWT, GAE, Android, Java SE and Java EE are also
available and keep synchronized with an automated and unique porting
process.
