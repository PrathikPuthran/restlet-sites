Connector service
=================

Introduction
============

This service declares client and server connectors. This is useful at
deployment time to know which connectors an application expects to be
able to use. Implementation note: the parent component will ensure that
client connectors won't automatically follow redirections. This will
ensure a consistent behavior and portability of applications.
