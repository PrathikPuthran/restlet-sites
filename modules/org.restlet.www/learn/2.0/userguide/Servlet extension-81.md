This extension is an adapter between the Servlet API and the Restlet
API. It allows you to nearly transparently deploy a Restlet application
in your preferred Servlet container such as Apache Tomcat.

Description
===========

It enables you to run a Restlet based application inside any Servlet
container such as Tomcat.

I just noticed that the javadoc and faq links point to the 1.1, rather
than 2.0 docs
