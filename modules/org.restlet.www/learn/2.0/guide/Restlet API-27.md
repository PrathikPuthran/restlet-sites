Restlet API
===========

Introduction
============

This chapter presents the Restlet API. It is a small set of packages,
with classes, interfaces and enumerations that together provide a
framework. This framework will guide you on the path to RESTful design
and development. But be aware that you still need to understand REST in
order to fully take advantage of the [Restlet
features](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201160659/http://www.restlet.org/about/features).
For this purpose, [we recommend the book "RESTful Web
Services"](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201160659/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/books)
from O'Reilly. We even wrote a part of it covering Restlet usage.

For a more detailed presentation of the API, we recommend that you have
a close look at the [Javadocs of the
API](http://web.archive.org/web/20111201160659/http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/api/)
available on the Restlet Web site. Below is a hierarchy diagram showing
the main concepts of the API and their relationships:

Here is a diagram illustrating how the API composes components,
connectors, virtual host and applications. Applications are in turn
composed of resources.

The link to the Api doc is to version 1.1, just like the link to the
tuturial.
