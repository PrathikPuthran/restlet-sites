Getting started with Eclipse IDE
================================

Introduction
============

There are two ways to use Restlet within Eclipse IDE. The first one is
to create a Java project and use the Restlet JARs as external
dependencies. This is very simple and works well in most cases.

The second way is to install Restlet JARs as Eclipse/OSGi bundles. All
Restlet JARs including dependencies are valid OSGi bundles, so this is
very convenient if you work in an Eclipse plug-in environment, such as
an Eclipse RCP application. You then just need to create a plug-in
project.
