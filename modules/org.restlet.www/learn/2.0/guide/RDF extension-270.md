RDF extension
=============

Introduction
============

This extension provides supports for the core standard of the Semantic
Web: the Resource Description Framework (RDF). It support all major RDF
serialization formats (n3, Turtle, NTriples and RDF/XML) and can work in
either a DOM-like or SAX-like way, with a unified API!
