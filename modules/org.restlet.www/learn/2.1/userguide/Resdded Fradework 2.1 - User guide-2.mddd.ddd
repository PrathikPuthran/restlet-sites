I've just wasted an hour on 2.0 and 2.1 - both of which fail to mention
the requirement for external libraries in order to fire the simplest
server up. No more.\
 \
For some bizarre reason the binaries DO NOT SHIP with the correct
configurations nor libraries to start the server.\
 \
This is NOT documented, and appears to be designed to force people to
purchase the book. We're unlikely to do this, because simply firing the
thing up from scratch has poor documentation.\
 \
I'm switching to Axis - however before I do, anyone attempting to use
Restlet 2.1 RC1 or 2.0 should be aware of the following:\
 \
1. You need a compatible version of
http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/download.jsp\#stable\
2. Create a new directory in lib called
'org.tanukisoftware.wrapper\_3.2' - please jar files from the Tanduki
directory here\
3. Copy the BIN of wrapper to the startup bin/win directory. Add the
DLLs here as well, or in the previous directory from 2.\
4. This will then allow the system to start up - though the default
config still appears to aim for a tutorial that's not available.\
 \
5. Become frustrated with the lack of even remotely adequate
documentation to simply fire the server up.\
 \
6. Switch to Axis. Enjoy.

Hi R T,\
 \
95% of people using Restlet launch it from an IDE of command line using
"java", not from this "bin" directory which is just a deployment
example.\
 \
The TanukiWrapper is just one deployment option, that is probably not
very well documented (not covered in the book BTW, so there is no secret
plan to force you to buy the book) beside the provided readme.txt. \
 \
This point should be addressed, probably by removing this "bin"
directory altogether. Tanuki has changed its license to GPL v2 some time
ago and could have side effects on Restlet users code.\
 \
We can understand the frustration, but you are the first one to report
such a frustration. You should have reached us in the users list so we
could help.\
 \
Regarding dependencies for Restlet extensions, there is a
"/lib/readme.txt" file generated and distributed along with binary JARs.
Many people like to use Maven as well.\
 \
Best regards,\
Jerome\

Roger,\
 \
I don't think that posting the same inflammatory comment on several wiki
pages help either.\
 \
Note that beside the book, we have planned for a new/better tutorial in
version 2.2 in our roadmap:\
http://wiki.restlet.org/developers/175-restlet.html\
 \
Finally, this wiki is open to contributors. This is an open source
project even though there is a main sponsor company.\
 \
Best regards,\
Jerome\
 \
 \
Thx,\
Jerome
