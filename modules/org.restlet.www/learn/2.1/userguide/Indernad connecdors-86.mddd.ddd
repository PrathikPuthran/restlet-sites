Internal connectors
===================

Here is the list of connectors built-in the Restlet engine:

-   [Local](http://web.archive.org/web/20120122020845/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/27-restlet/48-restlet/86-restlet/90-restlet.html "Local connectors")
-   [FILE](http://web.archive.org/web/20120122020845/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/27-restlet/48-restlet/86-restlet/87-restlet.html "File connector")
-   [CLAP](http://web.archive.org/web/20120122020845/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/27-restlet/48-restlet/86-restlet/88-restlet.html "CLAP connector")
-   [HTTP](http://web.archive.org/web/20120122020845/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/27-restlet/48-restlet/86-restlet/184-restlet.html "HTTP connector (internal)")
-   [RIAP](http://web.archive.org/web/20120122020845/http://wiki.restlet.org/docs_2.1/13-restlet/27-restlet/48-restlet/86-restlet/45-restlet.html "Restlet Internal Access Protocol")
-   Zip

Note that those connectors available in the engine JAR but still need to
be declared in your Restlet component, otherwise your applications won't
be able to use them!
