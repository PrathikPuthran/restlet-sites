   <h4>Introduction</h4>

   <p>
       While using the Restlet Framework, you may encounter issues that you want
       to report to us. Those issues can be of several types including bugs, 
	   enhancements or new features.
   </p>
   
   <h4>Check list</h4>

   <p>
       Before entering a new report, you should 
       <a href="https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open">query</a> the current 
       issue database for similar open issues. You might also want to talk about your
       issue with the community via the <a href="lists">discussion forums</a>. Make
       sure that you also consult the <a href="/about/faq">General FAQ</a> and the 
       Developer FAQ for your current version in the <a href="/documentation/">
       documentation section</a>. 
   </p>
   
   <h4>Reporting a new issue</h4>

   <p>
       The Restlet project relies on an issue tracker hosted at GitHub to manage
       all those reports. If you want to create a new report, you should first have a
       GitHub account. If necessary, you can create a new one by going to 
       <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">this page</a>. Then you should 
       go to the <a href="https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues/new">Issue Tracker page</a>.
      If you don't see the page to enter an issue, make sure that you are correctly
      logged into GitHub.

   <p>
      If you found a bug and fixed it locally, or if you developed an enhancement
      that could benefit to others, you are welcome to submit your code changes.
      You simply need to follow these steps:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>Verify that your local Git repository builds and passes all the unit tests (use the Ant script)</li>
      <li>Consider writing additional unit tests covering your contribution.</li>
      <li>Create a pull request on GitHub based on <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">those instructions</a></li>
      <li>Once your patch is accepted, a signed <a href="http://restlet.org/community/jca"> Copyright Assignment (JCA)</a> will be required</li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      Note that the JCA is necessary in order to maintain a principal copyright holder
      for the whole code base and allow us to propose <a href="http://restlet.org/about/legal">several open source licenses</a>
      in parallel, to upgrade to future versions of those licenses or to choose new ones.
   </p>

   <p>
      It also allows Restlet S.A.S. to offer restricted commercial licenses to other
      vendors or organisations wishing to incorporate and redistribute Restlet in their
      proprietary product without the constraints of our open source licenses or to develop
      custom versions without wanting to redistribute their changes publicly. In these
      case, it helps us to fund the ongoing development of our open source project.

   <h4>Professional Open Source</h4>
   <p>
      In order to balance this significant investment, Restlet S.A.S. has developped 
      <a href="http://www.restlet.com/services/">consulting services</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.restlet.com/products/">technical support</a> activities
      based on the success of the Restlet project. If you can afford to become a customer, 
      this is a great way to contribute to the funding of the Restlet project.
