   <h1>Contribute code</h1>

   <p>
      If you found a bug and fixed it locally, or if you developed an enhancement
      that could benefit to others, you are welcome to submit your code changes.
      You simply need to follow these steps:
   </p>

   <ol>
      <li>Verify that your local Git repository builds and passes all the unit tests (use the Ant script)</li>
      <li>Consider writing additional unit tests covering your contribution.</li>
      <li>Create a pull request on GitHub based on <a href="http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/">those instructions</a></li>
      <li>Once your patch is accepted, a signed <a href="http://www.restlet.org/community/jca"> Copyright Assignment (JCA)</a> will be required</li>
   </ol>

   <p>
      Note that the JCA is necessary in order to maintain a principal copyright holder
      for the whole code base and allow us to propose <a href="http://www.restlet.org/about/legal">several open source licenses</a>
      in parallel, to upgrade to future versions of those licenses or to choose new ones.
   </p>

   <p>
      It also allows Restlet S.A.S. to offer restricted commercial licenses to other
      vendors or organisations wishing to incorporate and redistribute Restlet in their
      proprietary product without the constraints of our open source licenses or to develop
      custom versions without wanting to redistribute their changes publicly. In these
      case, it helps us to fund the ongoing development of our open source project.
