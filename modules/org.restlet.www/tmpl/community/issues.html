   <h1>Report issues</h1>

   <h2>Introduction</h2>

   <p>
       While using the Restlet Framework, you may encounter issues that you want
       to report to us. Those issues can be of several types including bugs, 
	   enhancements or new features.
   </p>
   
   <h2>Check list</h2>

   <p>
       Before entering a new report, you should 
       <a href="https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open">query</a> the current 
       issue database for similar open issues. You might also want to talk about your
       issue with the community via the <a href="lists">discussion forums</a>. Make
       sure that you also consult the <a href="/about/faq">General FAQ</a> and the 
       Developer FAQ for your current version in the <a href="/documentation/">
       documentation section</a>. 
   </p>
   
   <h2>Reporting a new issue</h2>

   <p>
       The Restlet project relies on an issue tracker hosted at GitHub to manage
       all those reports. If you want to create a new report, you should first have a
       GitHub account. If necessary, you can create a new one by going to 
       <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">this page</a>. Then you should 
       go to the <a href="https://github.com/restlet/restlet-framework-java/issues/new">Issue Tracker page</a>.
      If you don't see the page to enter an issue, make sure that you are correctly
      logged into GitHub.
