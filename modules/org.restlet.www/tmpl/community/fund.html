   <h1>Fund the project</h1>

   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p>
      When Restlet S.A.S. founded the open source Restlet project, it made the
      choice of Professional Open Source. It means that it contributes most of the
      development effort, pays the core developers and the hosting expenses, provides
      technical leadership and integrates contributions from the community like bug
      reports, patches and documentation improvements.
   </p>

   <h2>Professional Open Source</h2>
   <p>
      In order to balance this significant investment, Restlet S.A.S. has developped 
      <a href="http://www.restlet.com/services/">consulting services</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.restlet.com/products/">technical support</a> activities
      based on the success of the Restlet project. If you can afford to become a customer, 
      this is a great way to contribute to the funding of the Restlet project.
   </p>

   <h2>Alternative funding</h2>
