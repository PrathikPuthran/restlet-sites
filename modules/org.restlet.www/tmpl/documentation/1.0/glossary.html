   <h2><a name="application">Application</a></h2>

   <p>
      Restlet that can be attached to one or more VirtualHosts.
      Applications are guaranteed to receive calls with their base reference
      set relatively to the VirtualHost that served them. This class is both a
      descriptor able to create the root Restlet and the actual Restlet that
      can be attached to one or more VirtualHost instances.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="client">Client</a></h2>

   <p>
      Connector acting as a generic client. It internally uses one of
      the available connectors registered with the current Restlet
      implementation.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="component">Component</a></h2>

   <p>
      Restlet managing a set of Clients, Servers and other Restlets.
      <br/>
      "A component is an abstract unit of software instructions and internal
      state that provides a transformation of data via its interface." Roy T.
      Fielding
   </p>

   <p>
      Component managing a set of VirtualHosts and Applications.
      Applications are expected to be directly attached to VirtualHosts.
      Components are also exposing a number of services in order to control
      several operational features in a portable way, like access log and
      status setting.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="connector">Connector</a></h2>

   <p>
      Restlet enabling communication between Components.
      <br/>
      "A connector is an abstract mechanism that mediates communication,
      coordination, or cooperation among components. Connectors enable
      communication between components by transferring data elements from one
       interface to another without changing the data." Roy T. Fielding
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Encapsulate the activities of accessing resources and transferring
      resource representations. The connectors present an abstract interface
      for component communication, enhancing simplicity by providing a clean
      separation of concerns and hiding the underlying implementation of
      resources and communication mechanisms." Roy T. Fielding
   </p>

   <h2><a name="context">Context</a></h2>

   <p>
      Contextual data and services provided to a Restlet. The context
      is the means by which a Restlet may access the software environment
      within the framework. It is typically provided by the immediate parent
      Restlet (Component and Application are the most common cases). The
      services provided are access to a logger, access to configuration
      parameters and to a request dispatcher.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="directory">Directory</a></h2>

   <p>
      Handler mapping a directory of local resources. Those resources
      have representations accessed by the file system, the WAR context or the
      class loaders. An automatic content negotiation mechanism (similar to
      the one in Apache HTTP server) is used to select the best representation
      of a resource based on the available variants and on the client
      capabilities and preferences.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="engine">Engine</a></h2>

   <p>
      A Restlet Engine is an implementation of the Restlet API. The
      reference implementation, provided by Restlet S.A.S., is therefore
      called the Restlet Engine (NRE).
   </p>

   <h2><a name="filter">Filter</a></h2>

   <p>
      Restlet filtering calls before passing them to an attached
      Restlet. The purpose is to do some pre-processing or post-processing on
      the calls going through it before or after they are actually handled by
      an attached Restlet. Also note that you can attach and detach targets
      while handling incoming calls as the filter is ensured to be
      thread-safe.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="finder">Finder</a></h2>

   <p>
      Restlet that can find the target resource that will concretely
      handle the request. Based on a given resource class, it is also able to
      instantiate the resource with the call's context, request and response
      without requiring the usage of a subclass. Once the target resource has
      been found, the call is automatically dispatched to the appropriate
      handle*() method (where the '*' character corresponds to the method
      name) if the corresponding allow*() method returns true.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For example, if you want to support a MOVE method for a WebDAV server,
      you just have to add a handleMove() method in your subclass of Resource
      and it will be automatically be used by the Finder instance at runtime.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If no matching handle*() method is found, then a
      Status.CLIENT_ERROR_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED is returned.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="guard">Guard</a></h2>

   <p>
      Filter guarding the access to an attached Restlet.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="redirector">Redirector</a></h2>

   <p>
      Rewrites URIs then redirects the call or the client to a new
      destination.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="representation">Representation</a></h2>

   <p>
      Current or intended state of a resource. For performance purpose,
      it is essential that a minimal overhead occurs upon initialization. The
      main overhead must only occur during invocation of content processing
      methods (write, getStream, getChannel and toString).Current or intended
      state of a resource.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "REST components perform actions on a resource by using a representation
      to capture the current or intended state of that resource and
      transferring that representation between components. A representation is
      a sequence of bytes, plus representation metadata to describe those
      bytes. Other commonly used but less precise names for a representation
      include: document, file, and HTTP message entity, instance, or variant."
      Roy T. Fielding
   </p>

   <h2><a name="request">Request</a></h2>

   <p>
      Generic request sent by client connectors. It is then received by
      server connectors and processed by Restlets. This request can also be
      processed by a chain of Restlets, on the client or server sides.
      Requests are uniform across all types of connectors, protocols and
      components.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="resource">Resource</a></h2>

   <p>
      Intended conceptual target of a hypertext reference. "Any
      information that can be named can be a resource: a document or image, a
      temporal service (e.g. "today's weather in Los Angeles"), a collection
      of other resources, a non-virtual object (e.g. a person), and so on. In
      other words, any concept that might be the target of an author's
      hypertext reference must fit within the definition of a resource."
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "The only thing that is required to be static for a resource is the
      semantics of the mapping, since the semantics is what distinguishes one
      resource from another." Roy T. Fielding
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Another definition adapted from the URI standard (RFC 3986): a resource
      is the conceptual mapping to a representation (also known as entity) or
      set of representations, not necessarily the representation which
      corresponds to that mapping at any particular instance in time. Thus, a
      resource can remain constant even when its content (the representations
      to which it currently corresponds) changes over time, provided that the
      conceptual mapping is not changed in the process. In addition, a
      resource is always identified by a URI.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="response">Response</a></h2>

   <p>
      Generic response sent by server connectors. It is then received
      by client connectors. Responses are uniform across all types of
      connectors, protocols and components.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="restlet">Restlet</a></h2>

   <p>
      Dispatcher that provides a context and life cycle support.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="route">Route</a></h2>

   <p>
      Filter scoring the affinity of calls with the attached Restlet.
      The score is used by an associated Router in order to determine the most
      appropriate Restlet for a given call.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="router">Router</a></h2>

   <div style="text-align: justify">
      Restlet routing calls to one of the attached routes. Each route
      can compute an affinity score for each call depending on various
      criteria. The attach() method allow the creation of routes based on URI
      patterns matching the beginning of a the resource reference's remaining
      part.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      In addition, several routing modes are supported, implementing various
      algorithms:
      <ul>
         <li>Best match (default)</li>
         <li>First match</li>
         <li>Last match</li>
         <li>Random match</li>
         <li>Round robin</li>
         <li>Custom</li>
      </ul>
      Note that for routes using URI patterns will update the resource
      reference's base reference during the routing if they are selected. If
      you are using hierarchical paths, remember to directly attach the child
      routers to their parent router instead of the top level Restlet
      component. Also, remember to manually handle the path separator
      characters in your path patterns otherwise the delegation will not work
      as expected.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Finally, you can modify the routes list while handling incoming calls as
      the delegation code is ensured to be thread-safe.
   </div>

   <h2><a name="server">Server</a></h2>

   <p>
      Connector acting as a generic server. It internally uses one of
      the available connectors registered with the current Restlet
      implementation.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="transformer">Transformer</a></h2>

   <p>
      Filter that can transform XML representations by applying an XSLT
      transform sheet.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="uniform">Uniform</a></h2>

   <p>
      Base class exposing a uniform REST interface.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "The central feature that distinguishes the REST architectural style
      from other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface
      between components. By applying the software engineering principle of
      generality to the component interface, the overall system architecture
      is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved.
      Implementations are decoupled from the services they provide, which
      encourages independent evolvability." Roy T. Fielding
      <br/>
      <br/>
      It has many subclasses that focus on a specific ways to handle calls
      like filtering, routing or finding a target resource. The context
      property is typically provided by a parent component as a way to give
      access to features such as logging and client connectors.
   </p>

   <h2><a name="virtual-host">Virtual Host</a></h2>

   <p>
      Router of calls from Server connectors to Restlets. The attached
      Restlets are typically Applications.
